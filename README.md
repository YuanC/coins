// This is just a simple script I wrote to keep track of my cryptocurrency stuff

Yes, I was too lazy to write my own output formatting function lol, so I used a library for it.
All you need is NodeJS for this.

Put your data into a file in the root directory called 'coins_data.json'. If this file is not found, the script will default to coins_data_default.json
